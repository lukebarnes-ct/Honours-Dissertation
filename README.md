#### Abstract

Previous work investigating the price distortion (defined as the log difference between the real
price and the fundamental value of the asset) of the S&P 500 has characterised it as having an
underlying bimodal distribution. This paper demonstrates that the supposed bimodality occurs only
under certain growth rate conditions. Methods are then extended to the TOP 40 index and 7 other
major market indices, from which it is seen that the strong bimodal shape of the distribution of the
price distortion of an index is a feature unique to the Shiller S&P 500 data set, due to the number
of dividend observations and growth rate. It is then shown that standard linear time series, appear
to be a good fit for the price distortion of the indices. Nonetheless, a certain class of agent-based
financial market models are shown to better characterise and explain some of the dynamics of the
price distortions.
